            "title_1": "What is Rahua?",
            "content_1": "<p>The Rahua® (ra-wa) name is derived from the rare ungurahua nut, found in the Amazon rainforest. Rahua oil is a highly effective treatment for transforming dry, damaged hair, giving it noticeable shine and health and nourishing and soothing skin.<\/p>",
            "title_2": "What can I expect when first trying Rahua® products?",
            "content_2": "<p>You can expect clean, shiny, soft and lustrous hair accompanied by the peace of mind that comes from knowing you achieved the results naturally. Our products are crafted with non-toxic, plant-based ingredients and with minimal impact on the environment. Because our products are free of harsh detergents, like sulfates (SLS), you will notice lighter lather than with traditional shampoos and body washes.<\/p>",
            "title_3": "How does Rahua define \"natural\"?",
            "content_3": "<p>To us, there is nothing more natural or beautiful than the bounty of the Amazon rainforest. Our goal as a business is to use this bounty—safeguarded by its indigenous peoples—to create the cleanest and greenest beauty products on earth. Rahua is an outgrowth of our founders’ activism on behalf of the rainforest and its peoples and is only as strong as the tribes and the forest itself. We purchase direct from tribespeople who cultivate ingredients using ancient traditional methods and and pay them a higher price in order to honor and sustain their work, their way of life, and the forest itself.<br\/>(<a href=\"http:\/\/fathomaway.com\/guides\/south-america\/ecuador\/itineraries\/amazon-rainforest-rahua-travel-debrief\/\">http:\/\/fathomaway.com\/guides\/south-america\/ecuador\/itineraries\/amazon-rainforest-rahua-travel-debrief\/<\/a>)<\/p>",
            "title_4": "What makes Rahua® different from other oil-based hair products?",
            "content_4": "<p>The majority of other oil-based products use chemical fillers and silicones, which coat your hair, providing short-term results. Rahua® products are made with pure handmade oils and organic and plant-derived ingredients. Rahua® oil has an extraordinarily small molecular structure, which deeply penetrates the hair, bonding to and repairing the cortex, while smoothing the cuticle to create lustrous and healthy hair.<\/p>",
            "title_5": "Where are Rahua® products made?",
            "content_5": "<p>All Rahua® products are formulated and made in the USA using plant-derived ingredients sourced from over 70 countries and Symbiotic® ingredients come from over 10 Amazonian nations. <\/p>",
            "title_6": "Does Rahua® test on animals?",
            "content_6": "<p>No. All Rahua® products are cruelty free. We do not test products on animals, nor use any animal proteins in the making of any Amazon Beauty® products.<\/p>",
            "title_7": "Is Rahua® fair trade?",
            "content_7": "<p>Our ethos goes beyond fair trade. Rahua® by Amazon Beauty® Inc.  is committed to preserving not only the Amazon rainforest, but also the indigenous people who call it home. We are dedicated to defending the Amazon rainforest and strengthening its communities financially and by educating them about their human and intellectual rights.<\/p>",

            "content_1": "<p>While many companies use the term “natural”, the US government does not define what it means to be a natural product or natural ingredients. The term \"natural ingredients\" is currently a non-defined cosmetic category.<\/p>",
            "title_2": "What are Symbiotic® ingredients?",
            "content_2": "<p>Symbiotic® is Rahua®’s signature standard. In order for an ingredient to be classified as Symbiotic®, it must be rainforest grown (wild) in undisturbed virgin forest, harvested and prepared using indigenous knowledge by people indigenous to the virgin forest environment, and it must be purchased at a price that helps to grow and sustain these traditions, build economies, and empower the indigenous people. <a href=\"\/admin\/themes\/43762057289\/%7B%7Bstore%20url=''%7D%7Dblog\/SymbioticCosmeticCategory\/\"><strong>More info here<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>",

            "title_4": "What are parabens and why are they harmful?",
            "content_4": "<p>Parabens are the most widely used chemicals for the preservation of beauty products. In research, parabens have been linked to illness and disease. Rahua® does not use parabens in any of its products. Instead, to increase the shelf life of our products we use an all-natural preservation system, including natural palo santo oil.<\/p>",
            "title_5": "What are sulfates and why are they bad for my hair?",
            "content_5": "<p>Sulfates are found in most shampoos and cleansers that produce lather or suds. They strip away healthy oils from your scalp and may cause dry scalp, dandruff or frizzy, dehydrated hair. Rahua® products contain zero sulfates and an abundance of nourishing oils to hydrate and heal your hair and scalp.<\/p>",
            "title_6": "How do you source your ingredients?",
